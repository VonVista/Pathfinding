## 💻 Description

A web application visualizing pathfinding and maze generation algortihms

Inspired by Clément Mihailescu's Pathfinding project 

## 🔎 Features

* Four pathfinding algorithms and three maze generation algorithms (currently)
* Creating walls, start and end points, and deleting cells by just interacting with the canvas
* Adjustable grid height and weight, as well as cell size
* Animation speed slider

## 🔭 Possible Additions
-  Icons for adjustments
-  Implement more pathfinding algortihms, specifically bidirectional algorithms
-  Implement recursive division for maze generation 

If there's any features you can suggest, feel free to let me know
